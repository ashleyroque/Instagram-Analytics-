## ðŸ“œ Project Overview  
This project aims to predict whether an Instagram post will have **high** or **low engagement** based on specific post characteristics. Engagement is measured by likes and comments, and the model enables predictions prior to posting. This project is essential for **brands**, **content creators**, and **marketers** looking to optimize their strategies and foster better audience interactions.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals  
1. **Predict engagement levels** (high/low) before a post is published.  
2. **Identify key features** influencing Instagram engagement.

---

## ðŸ“Š Dataset  
The dataset used is sourced from [Kaggle: Instagram Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/propriyam/instagram-data).  
**Key Features**:  
- `is_video`: Indicates if the post is a video.  
- `caption`: The text included in the post.  
- `comments`: Number of comments on the post.  
- `likes`: Number of likes the post received.  
- `followers`: Number of followers the user has.  
- `multiple_images`: Indicates if the post contains multiple images.  

**Target Variable**:  
- `engagement_level`: High or low engagement based on engagement rate.

---

## ðŸ§¹ Data Preprocessing  
- **Handling Missing Values**: Filled missing captions and locations with placeholders like `no caption` and `no location`.  
- **Feature Engineering**:  
  - Created `engagement_rate` using the formula:  
    \[
    \text{engagement\_rate} = \frac{\text{likes} + \text{comments}}{\text{followers}}
    \]
  - Classified posts as `high` or `low` engagement based on the median engagement rate.  
- **Boolean Conversion**: Converted `is_video` and `multiple_images` into numerical values (`1` for True, `0` for False).

## ðŸ“ˆ Visualizations  
### Correlation Heatmap  
Examined relationships between features such as followers, likes, and comments.  

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

correlation_matrix = df[['followers', 'likes', 'comments']].corr()
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', fmt='.2f', cbar=True)
plt.title('Correlation Heatmap of Instagram Features', fontsize=16)
plt.show()
```

### Bar Chart  
Compared average engagement rates for posts with single vs. multiple images.  

```python
post_type_engagement = df.groupby('is_video')['engagement_rate'].mean()
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 8))
post_type_engagement.plot(kind='bar', color='skyblue', ax=ax)
ax.set(title="Post Type Engagement", 
       xlabel="Post Type (0 = Image, 1 = Video)", 
       ylabel="Average Engagement Rate")
plt.show()
```

## ðŸ¤– Modeling  
- Used **Logistic Regression** for binary classification of engagement levels.  
- Achieved an **accuracy score of 98.93%** on the test set.  
- Evaluation included a confusion matrix and classification report.

```python
model = LogisticRegression() 
model.fit(X_train, y_train) 
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred) 
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)

# Detailed performance report
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred, target_names=['low', 'high']))
```

### Confusion Matrix  
```python
# Compute confusion matrix
cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)

# Plot confusion matrix
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.heatmap(cm, annot=True, fmt='d', cmap='Blues', xticklabels=['Low', 'High'], yticklabels=['Low', 'High'])
plt.title('Confusion Matrix')
plt.xlabel('Predicted Label')
plt.ylabel('True Label')
plt.show()

```

## ðŸ“– Insights  
1. Posts with **multiple images** showed slightly higher engagement on average.  
2. Engagement doesn't solely depend on follower countâ€”**timing, content type**, and **post format** are significant.  

---

## ðŸŒŸ Impact  
- **For Content Creators**: Offers insights to tailor posts for better engagement.  
- **For Brands**: Enhances posting strategies to reach a larger audience effectively.  
- **Ethical Considerations**: While useful, such models could incentivize creators to prioritize engagement metrics over authentic content.


---

## ðŸ’¡ Future Work  
- Experiment with advanced models like **Random Forest** or **Gradient Boosting** to address overfitting issues.  
- Explore additional features, such as **post timing** or **hashtag usage**.
